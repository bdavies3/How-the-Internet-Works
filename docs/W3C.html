    <h1>Part V: What's in a Website?</h1>
<br>

       <p> Ok so let's recap: First we learned what the Internet is. Then we found out how devices connect to the internet. We then moved onto how Websites work and how our devices find them. We're going to end our journey with a lesson on how a website is made: Enter HTML and CSS.Throughout creating this website I have become very familiar with HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). HTML is what these webpages are all built off of and CSS is what makes these webpages look so pretty. HTML just like HTTP and HTTPS is the language of websites.
      <br>
         <p>   HTML the language that tells the web browser what the web page should look like. HTML along with CSS are the building blocks to a web page. This website itself is built off HTML code. The specific page that we’re on right now is called W3C.html HTML code is used to build a webpage. Most web pages on the internet are built of HTML code. This code is used in this very website. It’s how I got the font to look like how it does, and what I used to space out all my sentences. HTML is how I linked the homepage to my different pages. It’s what I used to link images to each page.HTML code is the skeleton of this website. HTML can’t do it all alone though. That’s where CSS comes in. Cascading Style Sheets are files that blend with HTML elements to give websites more pizzazz. This website has a CSS file. I used it to make the background pink. CSS files allow HTML code to make all the changes that I spoke about. HTML in concert with CSS makes any website developer’s life much easier. Once you get a hang of it, the possibilities are endless. I’m speaking from experience. My first website might not have gone smoothly, but this time I got a hang of all the HTML code and the different things I can do with it. They’re truly a life saver.
<br>
      <p>Ok so now that we know what the internet is, who maintains the internet, how we can access it, how websites work, and how to make a website. The final topic is the W3C. We’ve already talked about one important internet organization, time for another. The W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) is an international organization that upholds the standard of the World Wide Web. (where we go to access websites and files on the internet) W3C is tasked with creating protocols and regulating the internet. If ICANN is the Internet’s janitor the W3C is it’s Dean. In order to get websites published they need to be in accordance with W3C standards. Every web developer must use code that fits W3C standards. They are the authority when it comes to web protocol. Beit HTML, CSS or Javascript code, it must pass W3C validation tests. These tests are what ensures that we have no syntax errors or anything that would make our website not up to W3C standards. W3C valid websites last longer and are just overall better websites. There are reasons for these standards, the W3C isn’t just a power hungry, authoritarian organization. These rules are put in place so that the internet runs at an optimal level. By keeping their standards high, they keep the quality of the internet high. Which makes the internet much easier and enjoyable to use. This is why an organization like W3C is necessary. Everything needs order.
<br>
      <p>Well that’s all for this website. I hope you’ve learned something about how the internet works. I know I have. Thanks!!</p>
