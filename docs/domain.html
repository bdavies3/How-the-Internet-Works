    <h1>Part I: What is the Internet?</h1>

 <p>Not to be cliché but Webster’s dictionary defines Internet as “an electronic communications network that connects computer networks and organizational computer facilities around the world —used with the exception when being used attributively” That’s a lot of words for something very simple, yet very complex. The internet is what connects billions of devices worldwide. But what is it really? This website has one purpose: to help ensure that people know the answer to that question.  The Internet has been a part of my life ever since I was born. It’s pretty much everywhere now. Especially in the US you can’t go a few feet without bumping into something that uses the internet.
<br>
 <p>The internet is vast and the amount of data on there is innumerable. Have you ever wondered who oversees all that data? As a kid I wondered where everything on the internet went, whether there was a King of the Internet who rules over everything and makes sure there’s order. Although that may be wrong, 9 year old me wasn’t entirely off base. There is an organization tasked with maintaining and stabilizing the numerous databases of the internet. They're known as ICANN. To learn more about ICANN, click  <a href="DNS.html">here</a>
    <br>
    <p>Now that we know about who regulates the internet, let’s figure out the ins and outs of it. How does it work? How can I send emails and videos from one device to another? Basically, everything on the internet is sent in bits, these bits are 1s and 0s all packaged together into bytes and sent through the internet. Just like morse code, different combinations of these 1s and 0s mean different things. A computer’s job is to translate those 1s and 0s. These bytes can become songs or movies, basically anything on the internet is made of bits and bytes. SO think of the Internet as the Postal Service and your computer as your mailbox. Websites and different pages on the interenet are made by sending these different bytes around with specific codes for making websites. I've provided an image below for a visual representstive of the different types of data that can be derived from a webpage.
