    <h1>Part II:What's an IP?</h1>
<br>

   <p> Before we get to IP addresses let's talk about web browsers. In the last part we talked about how bits and bytes are sent over the internet, relaying information to and from users. But how do users send that information. Do they just get on a computer, open up a terminal and code? That would be way too complicated. Which is why web applications like Web browsers were made. These browsers are your middle men between the Website and your computers. To put it in context: Your computer is basically a customer and the web browser is the uber driver  that gets you to where you want to go. Web browsers. You put a URL into your browser’s search bar, the browser reads the domain name of the website and sends you to that specific webpage. For more on Domain Names click  <a href="DNS.html">here</a> and for URLs click <a href="HTTP.html">here</a>
    <br>
    <p>An IP address should be familiar to anyone who’s ever tried to connect a device to the internet. IP addresses are basically labels given to any device that is connected to the internet. If you check your wifi settings on your smartphone you will find it’s IP address, same with your computer. An IP (internet protocol) address is how the internet knows where to send information to. Just as your home has an address so people know how to find it, your devices have an IP address so that they could be found on the internet. Now how do IP addresses work?IP addresses are given to devices so that they can be identified by different things on the internet, such as Web Browsers, the DNS, and IP Packets. All of which you have learned about or will learn about on this website. AS you will learn as you go along on this website, there are a lot of things that need IP addresses. It’s the form of communication on the internet. Only with an IP address will the web browser know where to send the information. For example: If I wanted to google something on my phone right now, I’d get the answer within seconds. That’s because my device sends signals to the web browser and that web browser takes those signals, finds what my device is looking for and sends information back to my device. Without IP addresses the browser would have no clue where to send the information. It’s like sending someone a letter in the mail without a return address.</p>
  <br>
   <p>We’ve talked over and over about bits and bytes being sent over the internet, but we haven’t gotten a clue how they get from one place to another. Don’t they get lost? That’s what packets are for. These packets of information are sent through a series of paths through the internet. It would be much easier to send them in direct lines to their destinations, but if the billions of devices in the world did that simultaneously, the internet would not be able to keep up. That’s why these packets are sent on different routes and paths. Just like you would to change your route because of traffic, so do these packets. If you thought the Cross Bronx had traffic, it has nothing on the internet. Now more on these packets; What exactly are in these packets of information, or IP packets? They can take anything, for example: mp3 files for music, or mp4 video files, anything. What if these files are too large? As we know the internet can’t take too much at once. Which is why the file gets split up by its bits, into different packets and moved along the information highway (internet). This makes distribution of information quicker and more efficient.
<br>
   <p>Now that we know about packets and how they work let’s talk about how they actually know where to go on the internet. Do they have GPS? No not necessarily. All these packets have are the bits stored in them, and information on where it’s from and where it's going. That’s not much to go on now is it. Imagine driving someplace and all you had was the address. Wouldn’t do you much help now would it? You would have to stop at a store or something and ask for directions. (well before google maps at least). Routers are basically these stores for the internet. Routers are computers that are tasked with navigating IP packets through the internet. These routers make sure your information is sent to where it’s supposed to be. It may sometimes take multiple routers depending on how much information there is to send, but routers act as gps for your IP packets.
