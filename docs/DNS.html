    <h1>Part III:DNS? Is that like DNA for computers?</h1>
<br>

    <p>Kinda, The DNS (Domain Name System) is the internets directory, Just like DNA stores our genetic information, the DNS stores Domain Names. Now what's a Domain Name? A Domain Name, to put it simply is how websites are identified. A domain name, is part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is how how different users can access a website. We'll talk in more detail about URL's in part IV. Here's an example of a domain name: www.espn.com, is the domain name for ESPN's online website. In the last part we spoke about how IP addresses are a series of numbers that are used to identify your device. We could use IP addresses for websites too but they're too difficult to remember, that's where domain names come in. Why are domain names so important? The reason domain names are important are because they're simple and easy to remember, while effectively being able to identify a website. A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, but it must end in one of the various domain name extensions, such as: .org/.com/.net etc. How do you choose a domain name? Well you have to register a domain name before using it. That way no one has the same domain name. That's why there aren't two youtube.com's. Your browser wouldn't be able to differentiate between the two. Domain Names have to be unique.
    <br>
       <p> That's where the DNS comes in. Continuing with the postal metaphors, if domain names are the addresses, then the DNS is like yellowpages. It’s what connects you to your website of choice. The DNS is what translates domain names into IP addresses in order for a web browser to be able to find them. This means domain names are useless without the DNS. In Part II we learned that IP addresses are how devices “speak” to web browsers. Web browsers need IP addresses in order to know where to send you. Domain Names are for humans. We can’t possibly be tasked with remembering all those numbers, so we have the DNS translate our easy to remember domain names into IP addresses. The DNS is like Google Translate for Web Browsers.
       <br>
     <p>The entire DNS system could be classified as the endgame for an IP packet. This is where your information ends up. Just like IP addresses represent your starting point Domain Names represent your endpoint.  So far we have learned how Information is sent through the internet and how information is identified on the internet. Now let’s talk about who keeps the internet running:
       <br>
    <p>ICANN</p>
            <p>Finally we can get to ICANN. ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) was founded in September 1998 is an american nonprofit organization tasked with maintaining the stability of the Internet, keeping it up and running. Their main focus is on the DNS ICANN is tasked with making the DNS more international, so that it can be readily available for use in other countries. ICANN holds a lot of power on the internet. They are entrusted with ensuring that the internet runs smoothly. In order to keep it going with my metaphors, you could say ICANN is the internet's Janitor/Maintenance worker. Making sure it's nice and tidy for us to use.
